<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This is a review from a different perspective - someone who doesn't review
monitors, or anything, and someone who actually cares about accurate colors.
This is also my first step into desktop HDR.</p>
<p>Gamers can go watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Fnmz2e_4xI">HUB</a></p>
<p>For context, my daily driver primary monitor is a ViewSonic VX2768. It is a
typical IPS display with a PFS phosphor WLED backlight. I regularly calibrate it
and use ACM in Windows 11 for all desktop apps other than those that have proper
color management. I use Firefox with a madVR 3dlut for video. Firefox by default
does not have color management for video and while Chrome's does, it is not correct.</p>
<p>These measurements are done with the new Calibrite Display Pro HL and DisplayCAL.</p>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2>

<p>This is a good looking monitor.</p>
<p>The actual panel is a bit larger than 2560x1440. I noticed that sometimes,
one side of the display has larger bezels. Turns out that it's got room to
move the entire image to reduce burn-in.</p>
<p>The viewing angles are not great. In the same first image, you can see that
any area outside the center is a slightly more blue. It's very noticable in
person, about 2' away from the display. This is not something I notice on my
cheaper IPS monitor.</p>

<p>At this brightness level, at 100% of the screen, the automatic brightness
limiter reduces the brightness to below that of 100% brightness at 100%
window size. These swings are extremely distracting when using the display as
a regular computer monitor, doing normal computer things and browsing the web.</p>

<p>70% is an estimate, but I adjusted it such that it is the largest window that
reaches 200 nits. This endeavor was ultimately a failure and the resulting
mapping is disgusting and looks even worse.</p>
<h3>HDR</h3>
<p>I am definitely doing something wrong because it all sucks. Please let me know
how to do it properly. There are zero guides out there.</p>
<h4>Pre-calibration</h4>
<pre style="font-size: 1.3em">
Target: BT.2020
Measured color temperature is around 6000K
Everything else: bad
</pre>
<p>I didn't bother testing against DCI-P3. If it's not profiled it doesn't
matter and is all WRONG.</p>

<h4>HDR calibration</h4>

10% window

Target tone curve: As measured

</pre>

<p>Profile compared to sRGB (white wireframe)</p>
<p>It looks like the display doesn't cover the entire sRGB volume. This is because
while it can produce 700 nits white, it is unable to produce 700 nits sRGB green.
In theory, the profiling should measure the display at different light levels to
produce a mapping of sRGB and other colorspaces at different target light levels.
For example, I want SDR content to have a white level at 200 nits, and it should
know how to map sRGB scaled to 200 nits using this profile. This is not possible.
HDR calibration does not work properly and can only rely on the display's tone mapping.</p>
<h2>Gaming experience</h2>
<p>I'm not a gamer in the sense that I don't play many games. So I only tried
this in MW2 (HDR) and Genshin Impact (Auto HDR).</p>
<p>MW2's HDR looked good, the colors weren't over-saturated and only the menus
looked like they had too much contrast. Dark scenes felt dark and had a lot of
detail and highlights and light effects looked cool. The only real problem is
that when I got flashbanged, the screen just turns gray.</p>
<p>Genshin Impact's Auto HDR didn't look great. It was over-saturated and the
contrast gave me a headache. In SDR, it looked even worse since on top of the
excessive contrast, when there were many effects on the screen, the dimming
caused it to look like there was an epilepsy filter.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The automatic brightness limiter of this display can't be turned off. It is
awful and you should not buy this monitor.</p>
<p>OLED monitors suck. The response times are better, but I don't notice it in
my regular use - not gaming. The blacks are deeper, but I'm in a well lit
environment so I don't notice it. The $1000 premium is NOT worth it.</p>
<p>HDR sucks. Or at least the current day implementations. The idea of HDR is
great. I want it. But this doesn't work. The main problem is that you can't profile
a display in HDR mode since the display does a lot of HDR processing
(<a href="https://hub.displaycal.net/forums/topic/madvr-hdr-3dlut-for-a-hdr-capable-monitor-question/#post-15620">Same comment from Florian of DisplayCAL</a>).
</p>
<p>What most people forget is that HDR does not mean it must be wide-gamut. More
vibrancy does not equal good. It is especially not good when it doesn't map to
the correct colorspace. And that is what profiling a display should enable.</p>
<p>With the praise that other OLED monitors have gotten for their HDR
performance and the idea that HDR in general was a big change, I set my
expectations too high. I was hoping for it to be life changing like HRR
and calibration. Unfortunately, I ended up extremely disappointed.</p>
<p>I am definitely returning this one. Maybe I just need to try the ASUS PG27AQDM next.</p>
